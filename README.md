    - Starting with the user, they will drop their first coin.
    - The computer will then play.
    - There are 3 End states:
        - Win State
        - Lose State
        - Draw State
    - Once one of the above conditions is met, the user will have the option of starting a new game or to just take a look at the end state of the board.

    ##Future developments

    I would like to one day implement a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
